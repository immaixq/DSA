## Graphs

Graph:: Data structure that specialises in relationships which tells how data is connected, for example the Facebook network 
- Each person is a node called vertex
- Each friendship, the connected line is called an edge
- Vertex connected by an edge is said to be adjacent 

### Meta VS X Network
The difference between Facebook network v.s X network is that the relationship in Facebook is mutual while X is one directional. For one directional graph, it's called **directed graph** while mutual connection is **non-directed graph**.
